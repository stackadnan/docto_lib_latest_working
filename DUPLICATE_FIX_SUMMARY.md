# Duplicate Prevention Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified
The Telegram bot was showing **inconsistent results** due to **race conditions** when multiple browser instances (20 instances) were running simultaneously:

- **Status showed**: Registered: 0, Not Registered: 2, Total: 2
- **Final Results showed**: Registered: 2, Not Registered: 4, Total: 6

## Root Cause
1. **Race Conditions**: 20 browser instances running concurrently
2. **No File Locking**: Multiple instances could read the same phone number before one removed it
3. **Duplicate Processing**: Same phone numbers processed multiple times
4. **Duplicate Entries**: Result files contained duplicate phone numbers

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Thread-Safe File Operations
- Added `threading.Lock()` for all file operations
- Added global `_processed_numbers` set to track processed numbers
- Prevents multiple instances from processing the same number

### 2. Duplicate Prevention in Results
- Enhanced `save_phone_result()` to check for existing entries before writing
- Prevents duplicate entries in `registered.txt` and `not_registered.txt`

### 3. Startup Cleanup Function
- Added `cleanup_result_files()` to remove duplicates from previous runs
- Automatically deduplicates result files at startup
- Marks previously processed numbers to prevent reprocessing

### 4. Reduced Concurrent Instances
- Reduced from 20 to 5 browser instances to minimize race conditions
- Better resource management and more stable processing

### 5. Enhanced Phone Number Management
- `get_next_phone_number()` now ensures unique number assignment
- Thread-safe removal from phone_numbers.txt
- Proper tracking of processed numbers

## Code Changes Made

### File: `play_wright.py`
1. **Added imports**:
   ```python
   import threading
   import time
   ```

2. **Added global variables**:
   ```python
   _file_lock = threading.Lock()
   _processed_numbers = set()
   ```

3. **Updated functions**:
   - `get_next_phone_number()`: Thread-safe with duplicate prevention
   - `save_phone_result()`: Checks for existing entries before writing
   - `remove_phone_from_file()`: Thread-safe file operations
   - `cleanup_result_files()`: New function for startup cleanup
   - `main()`: Reduced instances from 20 to 5

## Test Results
âœ… **Test passed successfully**:
- 10 phone numbers processed by 5 concurrent instances
- No duplicates in result files
- Correct total count: Expected 10, Actual 10
- All numbers properly distributed among instances

## Benefits
1. **Accurate Counting**: Telegram bot will now show correct numbers
2. **No Duplicates**: Result files will not contain duplicate phone numbers
3. **Better Performance**: Reduced instances improve stability
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Previous run duplicates automatically removed
5. **Thread Safety**: Safe for concurrent processing

## Verification
Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_duplicate_fix.py
```

The fix ensures that your Telegram bot will now display **accurate, consistent results** without the mathematical inconsistencies you were experiencing.
